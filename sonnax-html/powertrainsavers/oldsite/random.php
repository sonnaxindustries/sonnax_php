  differential breakage 4 or 5 times a year, costing us $4,000 - $5,000 each time. 
  Now we have no breakage and no down time which is a huge saving in both time 
  and money!&quot;</em>

  on both our Kremcos service rigs. They are a very good product. They have saved 
  us twisting off a drive-line or worse a time or two already. Wish I had them 
  years ago on my other rigs, might have saved my butt from crawling around a 
  nasty rig in the middle of the night changing a twisted off drive line. I would 
  recommend them to anyone using service rigs.&quot;</em>

&quot;The PowerTrainSaver is a no-brainer!&quot;, says Wade of Basnett Truck Services who is in the oilfield rig-moving business. &quot;Compare the parts we were breaking before we were using PowerTrainSavers - planetary gears and drive shaft yokes. With our bed truck rate of $450.00 per hour we can't afford to have down time. Now we have the Torque Fuses on our Bed Trucks and our Winch Tractors!&quot;</em>
