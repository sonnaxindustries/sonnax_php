        &quot;We had just installed a PowerTrainSaver on one of our a brand 
        new TWS 400 pumps. I was pressure testing and thought I had kicked out 
        the pump and hadn&#8217;t.....and I over pressured it. The Torque-Fuses 
        sheared during the over pressure and saved my bacon! Without the PowerTrainSaver Torque-Fuses in place I would have wrecked a $100,000 pump. 
      Good thing we had it on there!&quot;</div>

        Factory Option?</strong><font color="#FFFFFF"><br />
        </font>&nbsp;&quot;In 2001, Circle D started moving rigs in Southern Alberta. 
        Soon to follow was driveline trouble. At the time, Stan and Randy Friesen 
        were working with us and talked me into trying a couple of these driveline 
        savers. We started off by putting them into units that were down due to 
        over torque damage. After a few months we noticed a decrease in downtime.</div>
      <div align="justify">We started to install them in new units while in rig 
        up. It took a while for the drivers and pushes to accept the inconvenience 
        of a truck down for 20 minutes while they changed out the Torque-Fuses. 
        Compare that to putting a truck down for 3 days and $3,000 - $5,000 in 
        repairs. There were no arguments. As soon as Kenworth offers these units 
        as a factory option, all of our oilfield trucks will come with them already 
        installed.</div>

        Savers on our 20 truck tractors. We have been using them for 3 years now 
        and have had no down time. We used to have differential breakage 4 or 
        5 times a year, costing us $4,000 - $5,000 each time. Now we have no breakage 
        and no down time which is a huge saving in both time and money!&quot;</div>

        </font>&quot;The PowerTrain Saver is the neatest thing since sliced bread! 
        We have the PTS on twelve T600 Kenworth farm trucks used in our potato 
        fields. Prior to using the PTS on our trucks we were losing driveshafts, 
        rear ends, axel shafts, transmissions and clutches and tearing up motor 
        mounts. This is the first year since installing the PowerTrain Saver we 
        have had none of the above losses. We highly recommend this product to 
        anyone who wants to stop component damage on their trucks.&quot;</div>

        &quot;We are using the PowerTrainSaver on both our Kremcos service rigs. 
        They are a very good product. They have saved us twisting off a drive-line 
        or worse a time or two already. Wish I had them years ago on my other 
        rigs, might have saved my butt from crawling around a nasty rig in the 
        middle of the night changing a twisted off drive line. I would recommend 
        them to anyone using service rigs.&quot;</div>
